== Description ==

= View and Use Every Size of Your Images =

When you upload an image to your WordPress site, WordPress auto-generates lots of sizes of it. Unfortunately, the Media Attachment page doesn't display any information about the different image sizes, or the permalinks to use them. And the Attachment Display settings inside "Add Media" doesn't always show you all the sizes that exist. Until now.

= How to Use =

Just install and activate the plugin, and you'll see a list of all sizes of each image in both the "Add Media" pop-up modal, and in each image's individual page in "Media."

= Anything else? =

Well, read [read WPShout](http://wpshout.com/) for WordPress news and tutorials! And [contact us](http://pressupinc.com/) if you need help with WordPress.

== Installation ==

Install and activate the plugin. It'll work by default, and doesn't register any options pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Got a Question? =

Let us know, happy to help!

== Screenshots ==

1. Sizes on the "Insert Media" pop-up modal.
